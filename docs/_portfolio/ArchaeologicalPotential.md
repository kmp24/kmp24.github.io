This was a personal project from years ago when I was still active in archaeology. I read an interesting paper that laid out the process for predicting areas with high likelihood of archaeological sites, particularly those from before European colonization. These sites are frequently at risk from the effects of climate change - particularly erosion from increasing storms and rising sea levels. Additionally, there is a threat from human destruction and looting, which both disrespects the descendants of the people who made these sites and the archaeological record.

My analysis followed closely the process of Leden's 2009 paper, repurposed for analyzing Biddeford Maine, which is near where I grew up. The factors include soil makeup, slope, and proximity to various water sources.
