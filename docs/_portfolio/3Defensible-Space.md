As a senior member of the team, I worked with the product director to develop a methodology to analyze the effects of defensible space and it's impact of structure survivability in a wildfire. I was responsible for the data processing, cleaning, designing the analysis methodology, and discussing the final results with the product director to assist in determining the parameters of a new indicator to be added to our product offerings.

The analysis consisted of:
* Processing NAIP imagery and spatial structure data with structure attributes to feature engineering additional variables for analysis, mainly determining whether or not a home had defensible space prior to a wildfire
* Using the defensible space data and other protective structure measures to come up with a final model suitable for analysis
* Explore the results, which provided clearer guidance on what defensible space attributes and structure characteristics are actually determining factors in survivability
