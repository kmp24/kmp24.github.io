      "   Valley will continue to foster elevated to critical fire-weather\n",
      "   conditions in several areas across California, Nevada, and Arizona. \n",
      "   Models do indicate that the gradient between these two synoptic\n",
      "   features will slacken over the course of the forecast period and\n",

      "   ...Northern/central California...\n",
      "   Over the course of the day, surface heating/vertical mixing and the\n",

      "   wind speeds into the 20-35 mph range, with higher gusts (to 60 mph)\n",
      "   expected in typical terrain-favored areas.  The residing airmass is\n",
      "   dry and will remain so throughout the period, with critically low RH\n",

      "   Elevated to critical fire weather remains likely - with critical\n",
      "   highlights tied to areas of strongest surface winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ...Southern California...\n",
      "   The aforementioned offshore gradient will continue to maintain a\n",

      "   recovery resulting in critically low RH (5-15%) even at the start of\n",
      "   the forecast period (12Z Tue).  These dry conditions will persist\n",
      "   throughout the day as temperatures warm into the 70s and low 80s F. \n",
      "   Meanwhile, 25-35 mph northeasterly surface winds will develop\n",
      "   through the day, with gusts perhaps exceeding 60 mph especially in\n",
      "   terrain-favored areas.  Fuels remain dry across the region and\n",
      "   support of fire spread.  Elevated and critical delineations remain\n",
      "   in place to address the aforementioned scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ...Lower Colorado River Valley...\n",
      "   Latest models (and particularly high-resolution guidance) depict\n",
      "   areas of gusty northerly winds in the vicinity of the Lower Colorado\n",
      "   River that will strengthen into the 20-25 mph range with higher\n",
      "   gusts.  These winds will occur within a dry airmass, with widespread\n",
      "   single-digit RH values expected during the afternoon as temperatures\n",
      "   rise into the 70s and 80s F.  Dry fuel beds will potentially carry\n",
      "   large fires.  Thus, the critical delineation has been added.\n",
