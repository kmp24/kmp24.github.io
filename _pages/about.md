# About Me

<img src="/assets/images/wmnf arch.jpg" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">
  
I'm a geospatial data analyst who has worked for a variety of public land management agencies and industry, in primarily geospatial-oriented roles. I'm interested in data science and have experience primarily using python, working with pandas/geopandas, rasterio, shapely, gdal, ArcPy, and other open source tools including QGIS.

I have a bachelors degree in Geography-Anthropology from the University of Southern Maine, where I focused in archaeology and worked in the school's archaeology laboratory.
