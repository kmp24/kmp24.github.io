# About Me

![image](/assets/images/wmnfarch.jpg){: style="float: right"; margin-left: 10em; height="50%" width="50%"}
I'm a geospatial data analyst who has worked for a variety of public land management agencies and industry. I primarily use python with a variety of open source tools. I work for a data analytics company in the insurance sector on a wildfire exposure model product.

Currently, I am a MS student at the University of Maine in the Spatial Informatics program. My area of interest includes earth science, remote sensing, machine learning, and spatial data science. I have a bachelors degree in Geography-Anthropology from the University of Southern Maine. 

When I'm not consumed with all things geospatial, some of my hobbies and interests include mineral collecting, archaeology, playing the harp, and going on adventures with my dog.
